        Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):
    </p>
    <button class="accordion">When will my dog need to visit the veterinarian?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Upon first bringing your dog home, it's best to arrange a 
            physical exam with a local vet as soon as possible. This will give 
            you a chance to register your pup with a professional provider,
            review your dog's health history, and discuss any concerns you may
            have. It's important that you continue to bring your furry friend
            in for a check up each year to ensure that there are no underlying 
            issues. Your pup won't be able to tell you if something is 
            wrong, so your best bet is to be proactive!</p>
        </div>

    <button class="accordion">What should I feed my dog?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>It can be difficult to get a footing on pet food when there are 
            just so many options available! If you're bringing home a puppy,
            it's best to seek out commcercial "growth" food from a reputable
            brand. Certain dog breeds might require different kinds of 
            nutrition depending on their size and dietary needs. There are a 
            number of wonderful sites that provide valuable insight on this topic 
            (see our section on <a href="#additional"><u>additional resources</u></a>). 
            When in doubt, consult your veterinarian; they are happy to help!</p>

    <button class="accordion">Is it necessary to train and/or socialize my dog?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Here are TinDog, we think it of the utmost importance that 
            our furry friends are well-socialized. These positive experiences
            with humans and other dogs alike are critical in a dog's 
            healthy development. From walking around the neighborhood to 
            visiting local dog parks to enrolling in puppy classes, new 
            environments with new people is the way to go! But of course, if 
            your dog is visiting new places, it's best that they have some 
            level of training! Walking on a leash, responding to cues of "sit", 
            "stay", etc. are basic skills that we'd strongly recommend you 
            work with. But remember: positive reinforcement (treats, praise) is 
            truly the tried-and-tested method. So whether you're beginning 
            your training at home or with a professional, make sure you are 
            encouraging the behavior that you want to see!</p>
        </div>
        
    <button class="accordion">How much attention will my dog need?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Dogs are incredibly curious and sociable animals. They
            get attached to their humans, and they feel sad when their 
            humans are gone! Thus if a pet dog is your calling, it's 
            critical that you ensure that your lifestyle is ready to 
            accommodate a fairly-needy family member. Much like small 
            human children, our furry friends require both physical and 
            mental exercise; whether it's going for a daily walk, playing 
            a few games of chase or tug-of-war, or snuggling up on the couch,
            your pup will appreciate the time you two spend together. During 
            times when you need to leave the house, be sure to provide 
            safe chew toys, a food puzzle, or a visit from a dog walker if 
            you'll be gone for the majority of the day. If you need to 
            leave home for a period of travel, make plans for a qualified 
            pet sitter to visit the house and provide care.</p>
        </div>
        
    <button class="accordion">Are dogs expensive? How much money can I anticipate spending?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>While the cost of caring for a pet can vary greatly from owner to
            owner, most aspiring dog owners should plan to spend upwards of 
            $500-2,000 on the initial expenses to adopt, purchase supplies, and 
            connect with a veterinarian for a new-puppy check up. Additional 
            medical costs such as spaying/neutering, heartworm medication, etc. 
            will further contribute to the bill, and if you seek pet insurance 
            (which is generally recommended, as it resembles human health 
            insurance), then that will incur additional costs. It then becomes 
            necessary to account for money spent each month on replenishing food, 
            toys, etc. And of course, if travel is in your future, you should 
            also anticipate the cost of a pet sitter. Because of this, most pet 
            owners find that a dog requires anywhere between $800-3,000 of 
            annual care.</p>
