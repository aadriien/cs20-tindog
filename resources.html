            Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):
        </p>
        <button class="accordion">When will my dog need to visit the veterinarian?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Upon first bringing your dog home, it's best to arrange a 
                physical exam with a local vet as soon as possible. This will give 
                you a chance to register your pup with a professional provider,
                review your dog's health history, and discuss any concerns you may
                have. It's important that you continue to bring your furry friend
                in for a check up each year to ensure that there are no underlying 
                issues. Your pup won't be able to tell you if something is 
                wrong, so your best bet is to be proactive!</p>
            </div>
    
        <button class="accordion">What should I feed my dog?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>It can be difficult to get a footing on pet food when there are 
                just so many options available! If you're bringing home a puppy,
                it's best to seek out commcercial "growth" food from a reputable
                brand. Certain dog breeds might require different kinds of 
                nutrition depending on their size and dietary needs. There are a 
                number of wonderful sites that provide valuable insight on this topic 
                (see our section on <a href="#additional"><u>additional resources</u></a>). 
                When in doubt, consult your veterinarian; they are happy to help!</p>
            </div>
    
        <button class="accordion">Is it necessary to train and/or socialize my dog?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Here are TinDog, we think it of the utmost importance that 
                our furry friends are well-socialized. These positive experiences
                with humans and other dogs alike are critical in a dog's 
                healthy development. From walking around the neighborhood to 
                visiting local dog parks to enrolling in puppy classes, new 
                environments with new people is the way to go! But of course, if 
                your dog is visiting new places, it's best that they have some 
                level of training! Walking on a leash, responding to cues of "sit", 
                "stay", etc. are basic skills that we'd strongly recommend you 
                work with. But remember: positive reinforcement (treats, praise) is 
                truly the tried-and-tested method. So whether you're beginning 
                your training at home or with a professional, make sure you are 
                encouraging the behavior that you want to see!</p>
            </div>
            
        <button class="accordion">How much attention will my dog need?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Dogs are incredibly curious and sociable animals. They
                get attached to their humans, and they feel sad when their 
                humans are gone! Thus if a pet dog is your calling, it's 
                critical that you ensure that your lifestyle is ready to 
                accommodate a fairly-needy family member. Much like small 
                human children, our furry friends require both physical and 
                mental exercise; whether it's going for a daily walk, playing 
                a few games of chase or tug-of-war, or snuggling up on the couch,
                your pup will appreciate the time you two spend together. During 
                times when you need to leave the house, be sure to provide 
                safe chew toys, a food puzzle, or a visit from a dog walker if 
                you'll be gone for the majority of the day. If you need to 
                leave home for a period of travel, make plans for a qualified 
                pet sitter to visit the house and provide care.</p>
            </div>
            
        <button class="accordion">Are dogs expensive? How much money can I anticipate spending?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>While the cost of caring for a pet can vary greatly from owner to
                owner, most aspiring dog owners should plan to spend upwards of 
                $500-2,000 on the initial expenses to adopt, purchase supplies, and 
                connect with a veterinarian for a new-puppy check up. Additional 
                medical costs such as spaying/neutering, heartworm medication, etc. 
                will further contribute to the bill, and if you seek pet insurance 
                (which is generally recommended, as it resembles human health 
                insurance), then that will incur additional costs. It then becomes 
                necessary to account for money spent each month on replenishing food, 
                toys, etc. And of course, if travel is in your future, you should 
                also anticipate the cost of a pet sitter. Because of this, most pet 
                owners find that a dog requires anywhere between $800-3,000 of 
                annual care.</p>
